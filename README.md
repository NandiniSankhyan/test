GitLab Release Management with Protected Branches
Introduction
This README file outlines the release management process for a GitLab project, focusing on the usage of protected branches to control the flow of code through different stages of development. There are three protected branches: pre-main, main, and production-release. Additionally, feature branches are not protected, which means they are used for development and testing purposes, and the real deployment occurs only on protected branches.

Protected Branches
1. pre-main Branch
Purpose: This branch is the first step in the development pipeline. Feature branches can commit to pre-main, allowing for code integration and deployment to a development environment.

Pipeline Actions:

Syntax Check: Pipeline checks for syntax errors.
Deployment: Code is deployed to the development environment for testing.
Merge Condition: If all changes are applied correctly and tested, code can be merged into the main branch.

2. main Branch
Purpose:

Always have a working pipeline with the latest deployed code.
Act as a backup option to restore the working state in case of code loss during merges in pre-main.
Pipeline Actions:

Syntax Check: Pipeline checks for syntax errors.
Deployment: Code is deployed to maintain the latest version of the application.
Merge Condition: Code from pre-main is merged into main once it has been thoroughly tested and validated.

3. production-release Branch
Purpose: This branch is responsible for releasing and deploying code to the production environment.

Pipeline Actions:

Deployment: Code is deployed to the production environment for release.
Merge Condition: Code from main is merged into production-release when it is ready for production deployment.

Feature Branches
Feature branches are not protected, which means they are open for development, but they cannot access protected environment variables or trigger real deployments. These branches serve as workspaces for developers to collaborate, develop features, and perform syntax checks. Deployment only occurs when code is merged into the protected branches (pre-main, main, or production-release).

Workflow Overview
Feature Development:

Developers work on feature branches.
Feature branches can commit to pre-main for integration and deployment to the development environment.
Testing and Validation:

Code on pre-main is tested and validated.
If successful, code is merged into main.
Continuous Deployment:

main maintains the latest working code and can be used to restore the working state if needed.
Production Deployment:

Code from main is merged into production-release.
Code is deployed to the production environment for release.
Conclusion
This GitLab release management process, utilizing protected branches and feature branches, ensures a controlled and organized development workflow. It promotes testing, validation, and stability before code is deployed to production, reducing the risk of errors and disruptions in the production environment.
